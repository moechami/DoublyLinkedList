# DoublyLinkedList

Introduction

This repository provides a Python implementation of a Doubly Linked List (DLinkedList) data structure. A doubly linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node contains data and two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements from any position in the list.
Features

    Add elements to the front or back of the list.
    Insert elements after a specified node.
    Remove elements from the front or back of the list.
    Find elements within the list.
    Reverse the list order.
    Check if the list is empty.
    Print all elements in the list.
